BuildStep instances are now more strict about when their attributes can be changed.
Changing attributes of BuildStep instances that are not yet part of any build is most likely an error.
This is because such instances are only being used to configure a build.
In this scenario any attribute changes are ignored as far as build configuration is concerned.

Such changing of attributes has been deprecated and will become an error in the future release.

For customizing BuildStep after an instance has already been created `set_step_arg(name, value)` function has been added.
