.. _5.0_Upgrading:

Upgrading to Buildbot 5.0 (not released)
========================================

Upgrading a Buildbot instance from 4.x to 5.0 may require some work to achieve.

The recommended upgrade procedure is as follows:

  - Upgrade to the last released BuildBot version in 4.x series.

  - Remove usage of the deprecated APIs.
    All usages of deprecated APIs threw a deprecation warning at the point of use.
    If the code does not emit deprecation warnings, it's in a good shape in this regard.
    You may need to run the master on a real workload in order to force all deprecated code paths to be exercised.

  - Upgrade to the latest Buildbot 5.0.x release.

  - (Optional) Upgrade to newest Buildbot 5.x.
    The newest point release will contain bug fixes and functionality improvements.

Testing support
===============

The ``build_files``, ``worker_env`` and ``worker_version`` arguments of
``TestBuildStepMixin.setup_step()`` have been removed. As a replacement, call
``TestBuildStepMixin.setup_build()`` before ``setup_step``.
